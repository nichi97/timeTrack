# Time Track

This is my personal progress tracking / time management hub. 

## Why this repo?

I want to keep myself accountable, and become more aware of how my time is spent

## How I used this repo?

Before each period, I would write down my goal for the hour. After I finished this period, I would come back to check if I accomplished the goal I set for myself, and I would also add additional comments for this particular hour
